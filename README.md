#Poloniex lending bot <img src="https://nevet.me/public/icon.png" width="50">

The Poloniex lending bot is written in Python and features automatic lending on the exchange Poloniex.
It will automatically lend all cryptocurrencies found in your lending account.

It uses an advanced lending strategy which will spread offers across the lend book to take advantage of possible spikes in lending rates. Inspired by [MarginBot](https://github.com/HFenter/MarginBot) and [BitfinexLendingBot](https://github.com/eAndrius/BitfinexLendingBot).
